# Big-Data-Analytics
This repository contains a project from the Program Based Internship Big Data Analytics from the Kimia Farma company in collaboration with Rakamin Academy.

## Background
Kimia Farma was the first pharmaceutical industry company in Indonesia established by the Dutch East Indies Government in 1817. The name of the company was originally NV Chemicalien Handle Rathkamp & Co. Based on the nationalization policy of former Dutch companies in the early days of independence, in 1958, the Government of the Republic of Indonesia consolidated a number of pharmaceutical companies into PNF (State Pharmaceutical Company) Bhinneka Kimia Farma. Then on August 16, 1971, the legal form of PNF was changed to a Limited Liability Company, so the company name changed to PT Kimia Farma (Persero).

## Objective
When working on the Big Data Analytics project, I did several stages as follows:

1. Designed data mart using PostgreSQL and analyzed sales data to drive optimization and improvement of product development and business strategies.
2. build reports and present information using Google Data Studio.

## Evaluation
I recommend adding some data that is not yet available in the database to complete the analysis. Here are some of the features I recommend:

1. Longitude latitude data for each customer location  
- the purpose is to see the distribution of customer locations.  
- from this data, we can see potential locations that we can approach to become customers.  
- besides that, we can also predict the demand for location 1A to the surrounding locations from the need for drugs in certain locations at certain times. for example, it is rainy season in area A so that the need for drugs around the area is related to flu or fever drugs. and we can allocate drug stocks to certain distributors / branches against the demand prediction.  

2. Weather data
- to see the correlation between drug demand and weather in the area
